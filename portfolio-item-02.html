		<p>
			This code was written as a final group project for a Java programming class. We utilized the JavaFX library to create an interactive GUI to improve user experience. The application has relatively basic tools, but this was the first project that I needed to dive into mouse events and translating the desired result into code.
		</p>
		<img src="img/portfolio-details.jpg" alt="Image" />
		<p>
			The application uses the GraphicsContext library to create each expected shape. Each object is created using a combination of a switch and if/else statements to ensure proper functionality of each feature. The mouse event that triggers the output on the screen depended on the shape being created.
			 This was the first project that I extensively interacted with a GUI, literally coding features that were immediately displayed within the GUI. This was particularly challenging for me, as it was quite different from any of the previous console applications that I've created in other classes.
			 Coming up with the logic required to have the pencil and spray tools act correctly was difficult with the way we already established the drag and drop tools. What seemed simple ended up requiring a ton of digging through the Oracle documentation in order to produce the expected result.
		</p>
		<p>
			
			Regardless, this was an incredibly rewarding project to complete. Thoroughly reading through the documentation of an unknown library and implementing the code successfully was challenging. Since this was my first legitimate GUI application, seeing the visual result of the working code was immeasurably gratifying.
			 The collaboration between team members was a great experience and gave me a sense of what programming in a real world setting feels like. We were able to delegate specific features to each team member throughout the week, and combine code during each of our weekly meetings. I enjoy working in a team, and this was
			 a motivating factor throughout the production of this application.
